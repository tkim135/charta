### Synopsis

Most students donâ€™t graduate from college on time; one-third never will. This is an existential crisis to higher education. Moreover, students who don't finish college do not reap the benefits of a degree: a happier, healthier, and wealthier life. We are solving this problem by building a software platform to help students chart their course to graduation and allowing school administrators to identify those at-risk for dropping out.
