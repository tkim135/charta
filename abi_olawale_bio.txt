Hi, I’m Abi. I’m a senior and coterm in Computer Science, specializing in AI with a particular focus in NLP. I’m especially interested in how we can use NLP to make technology more inclusive for all. I love reading, and I’m currently reading Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates and And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie.
